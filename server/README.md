# Server

* This is the server part.
* You should run **_main.py_** in order to get started.

### HOW-TO(config.json)

* **_data_max_length_**( int ) decides how much a packet will be sent.
* **_server_host_**( str ) is your server ip.
* **_ports_**( list[int, int] ) decides which ports you'll open for connections.
* **_file_log_**( bool ) decides whether what it prints on the console will be written is a file called ServerLog.log.

#### Tips:

* server_host only includes the intranet ip address of your server.
* please check the config before you start.
